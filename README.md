<span style="color:red">Content warning.</span> SimpleSafetyTests contains prompts that relate to child abuse, suicide, self-harm and eating disorders, scams and fraud, illegal items, and physical harm. They are highly sensitive and you could find them harmful.

<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">SimpleSafetyTests.</span> comprises 100 handcrafted English test cases across five harms (Suicide, Self-Harm and Eating Disorders; Physical Harm; Illegal and Highly Regulated Items; Scams and Fraud; and Child Abuse). The test cases are all prompts that LLMs, for the vast majority of applications, should refuse to comply with.
